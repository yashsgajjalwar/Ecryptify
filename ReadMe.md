# AES Encryptor/Decryptor

AES Encryptor/Decryptor is a Python-based tool for securing sensitive data through encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.

## Features

- **Secure Encryption**: Utilizes AES encryption algorithm to securely encrypt plaintext data with user-defined passwords.
- **Symmetric Key**: Employs symmetric key encryption, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Provides a straightforward command-line interface for encrypting plaintext or decrypting encrypted data.
- **Variable Key Sizes**: Supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits for varying levels of encryption strength.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Utilizes base64 encoding for secure representation of encrypted data and file operations.
- **Password Confirmation**: Ensures password integrity by confirming user-entered passwords to prevent input errors.
- **Enhanced Security**: Enhances data security and privacy by empowering users to protect their confidential information effectively.
